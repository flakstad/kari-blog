_A manifesto for principled software builders who honor craft, integrity, and the user’s freedom._

This is a manifesto for creators who refuse to build noise. It is an
oath to create only what is worthy. For ourselves. For those who value
their time. For a world that deserves better tools. To build software
that empower users, respect their freedom, and endures beyond fleeting
trends.

<!--more-->

## 1. Build with integrity

I reject the siren call of market trends, praise, or pressure. I will
create what should exist: what is right and necessary, and what honors
the user’s time, focus and sovereignty. Worthy software solves real
problems, enhances human potential and respects autonomy without
compromise. My work bears my name, undiluted. I serve users by serving
the work. The world's recognition is secondary; I ship now.

## 2. Empower the individual

I build to liberate, not trap. My tools enable the individual's focus,
freedom and choice, holding their time and attention sacred. I reject
manipulation with fake urgency, dopamine loops or vanity metrics. Time
is life. I measure outcomes that reduce time-to-value and errors, not
engagement for its own sake. I design for opt-in attention and
reversible choices. Like a well-made pen, my tools vanish in use,
freeing users to live beyond the screen.


## 3. Your data, your property

You own your information. I am its steward while you choose to store
it here. You can take it, in full, at any time, in open documented
formats. I will not spy, sell, or silently change the rules. Where law
or physics constrain portability, I will state those limits plainly
and early, and provide export tools and deletion guarantees.


## 4. AI as servant, never master

AI amplifies human intent; it does not replace it. It may suggest,
whether in code completion or creative exploration, but it never
dictates. Its actions are transparent, attributable, reversible and
bounded by explicit user permissions. Human override is always
available.


## 5. Simplicity is strength

I build with restraint: fewer features, each chosen with care to serve
the user's intent. What I remove is as vital as what I keep. No
additions for applause or competition. I resist the temptation to
overreach, overpromise, or overbuild. Simplicity is discipline:
stripping away the unnecessary, leaving tools that let people focus on
what matters.

Simplicity is not ease. Ease seduces with familiarity and instant
reward. Simple means untangled: concerns kept separate, parts that
compose, dependencies kept few. Easy piles on shortcuts until nothing
can move. Simple asks for thought up front, but yields tools that
endure: clear, reliable, and straightforward to reason about.

## 6. Craft with discipline

I will not ship ugliness. Software is a craft, and beauty matters.
Accessibility, security, performance budgets, and reliability are
non-negotiable parts of done. I will ship fewer features, built well
and on time, rather than many done poorly. I seek the balance between
excellence and delivery. Neither perfection that paralyzes nor
mediocrity that corrodes.


## 7 Profit on my terms

 I sustain my work through transparent, voluntary transactions,
 answering only to those who value it. I reject surveillance, deceptive
 design, and hidden deals. Pricing is simple and predictable. There are
 no lock-in terms. Refunds are fair. Cancellation is as easy as
 sign-up.


## 8 Build for the long term

I will not chase hypergrowth or exits. I may accept funding when it
strengthens the work, but never at the cost of integrity. I will
design my systems to last, using stable tools and minimal
dependencies, so small teams can maintain them and weather storms
without panic. I will choose durability over trend-chasing, stability
over spectacle.

## 9 Collaboration and community

Collaboration is a voluntary exchange of value, where creators unite
without sacrificing vision. I join others to amplify strengths, not
dilute purpose. Decisions have clear owners; contributions are
credited; dissent is welcomed and examined; rationales are recorded.
Community is a chorus of independent voices, harmonized by shared
respect, not conformity.

## 10 Stillness and focus

I will create in stillness, unswayed by noise or urgency. I minimize
notifications and meetings. I focus on what I control: my craft, my
purpose. And I accept what I cannot, finding strength in clarity. I
act where my will and effort matter, and release what lies beyond my
control. My energy will not be wasted on outrage, trends or tides I
cannot turn. I focus on the work itself, for that is mine to command.

## 11 The work is the reward

The work is my purpose. I build for the joy of crafting what is
worthy, trusting its value will endure, whether seen or unseen by
others.

## Epilogue

I call on creators to join me in this pledge: to build with purpose,
honor the user and let the work stand as our truth. Adopt these
principles in your craft, share them with others and build software
that reflects this vision. Together, we can create a world of tools
that empower, not enslave.
